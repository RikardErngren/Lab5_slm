DA4007 - Lab5 - 'small language model'

A LanguageModel object consists of:
k - the length of words,
filename - the name of the language,
kgram_freq - the frequencies of which different k-grams occur,
transition_freq - the frequencies of which characters come after the different k-grams.

Note that output text length is not relevant to the language model, that's handled by the TextGenerator (To be continued).
